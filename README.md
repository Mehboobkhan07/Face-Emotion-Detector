Face Emotion Detection using Deep Learning
Overview
This project implements a real-time face emotion detection system using deep learning techniques. The goal is to accurately identify and classify human emotions based on facial expressions in live video feeds. The system leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for effective feature extraction and emotion classification.

Key Features
Deep Learning Architecture: The project employs a sophisticated CNN architecture designed for optimal feature extraction and emotion classification.

Real-Time Implementation: Integrated with OpenCV, the system provides instant emotion predictions from live video streams, making it suitable for real-world applications.

Diverse Dataset: The model is trained on a diverse dataset containing a broad range of facial expressions. This diversity enhances the model's robustness and generalization capabilities.

Evaluation Metrics: Model performance is evaluated using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, providing a comprehensive understanding of its effectiveness.
